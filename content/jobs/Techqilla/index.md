- Situation: I joined TechQilla as a Full Stack Developer, the development process was unstructured, there was a lot of legacy codebase, projects were not standardized, leading to inefficiencies and maintainability challenges.
- Task: I was tasked with improving the overall procedure of the development process and maintaining.
- Action: Firstly I started with sorting out all the current issues, then I began by setting standards and documents for helping in future development. I evaluated and selected a modern stack, transitioning the team from legacy systems to more efficient technology frameworks. I also set up CI/CD pipelines for streamlined deployments and promoted best practices for code review and testing. Established guidelines for writing clean and maintainable code, and implemented tools such as linters, code formatters, and version control practices.
- Result: These practices helped us achieve significant enhancements on development time, performance of the applications, user experience and team productivity.
