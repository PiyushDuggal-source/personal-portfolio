This project uses Python's [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) and [MediaPipe](https://ai.google.dev/edge/mediapipe/solutions/guide) to detect hand gestures and allow the user to control an image on the screen using their hand gestures. Pinching and stretching the hand allows the user to zoom in and out of the image!
