This is `Sirim`, a personal virtual assistant that lives in your local computer, no API calls, no sending data anywhere, just pure local inference!

The inspiration for the name `Sirim` comes from `Vim` which is `Vi + Improved` so, its `Siri + Improved`.

`Siri` only works for simple tasks like, calculation, telling a joke or two, but `Sirim` is a personal assistant that works as an AI model and we have the freedom to your any AI model.
